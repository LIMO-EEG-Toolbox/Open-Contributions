# Open-Contributions

The LIMO-EEG Toolbox is an open project for statistics in EEGLAB. 
If you are interested in having a feature and/or want to contribute you most welcome, drop me (@cyril) an email.

_Here a bunch of things we could do to make the toolbox better_

## Optimization

If you are into code optimization, we have many bootlenecks and would love to see things optimized

## Bayesian stats

From our GLM and other stats, we can easily derive BIC - that woiuld be a cool fearture to have

## Time-Frequency testing

For now, tool exist for time-frequency but it's still a bit bugy

## unitesting

Yep, that's pain we did not wrote unitest - got to do that

## multivariate stats

decoding in time across channels/IC/freq is something that would be nice to have

## testing for onset

This quite a difficult thing to do ! we have some idea but no much time
